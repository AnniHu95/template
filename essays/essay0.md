One of my friends she is in the MIS major, and when we were talking about majors,she highly recommended me to join her. 

Because I was undecided major, and I'm good at math. I emailed my mother's former proffessor, when she was finishing her PHD here in UHM, and he said MIS would be a great choice as well. However, I know that I'm not good at computers, and I'm afraid of it as well. But I would like to try, because as mentioned, I am a risk taker, and I couldn't just run away by not trying it.

However,I am a tryer, also a risk taker.

**Try everything!
